Questions and Answers:-

1)What's wrong with the following program?

public class SomethingIsWrong {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Rectangle myRect;
        myRect.width = 40;
        myRect.height = 50;
        System.out.println("myRect's area is " + myRect.area());
    }
}

Ans)Rectangle class is not there so no object with Rectangle will be created.So compilation error will occur"cannot find 
symbol".

2)The following code creates one array and one string object. How many references to those objects exist after the code 
executes? Is either object eligible for garbage collection?

...
String[] students = new String[10];
String studentName = "Peter Parker";
students[0] = studentName;
studentName = null;
...

Ans)The array students has one reference to the object studentName even though that object has been assigned the value null.
The object studentName has students[0] that refers to it.
String object is eligible for garbage collection as its reference has been assigned null.

3)How does a program destroy an object that it creates?
Ans)A program never destroys an object,it can only make the reference of the object available for garbage collection by
assigning null value to it.
