b)What are the instance variables?
Ans b)Instance Variable is 'y'.

c)What is the output from the following code:

IdentifyMyParts a = new IdentifyMyParts();
IdentifyMyParts b = new IdentifyMyParts();
a.y = 5;
b.y = 6;
a.x = 1;
b.x = 2;
System.out.println("a.y = " + a.y);
System.out.println("b.y = " + b.y);
System.out.println("a.x = " + a.x);
System.out.println("b.x = " + b.x);
System.out.println("IdentifyMyParts.x = " + IdentifyMyParts.x);

Ans c)
a.y = 5
b.y = 6
a.x = 1
b.x = 2
IdentifyMyParts.x = 2
